Database created in Oracle SQL developer for a hypothetical nonprofit with maximal functionality


The creation of this database was instrumental in cultivation my understanding of SQL. The data contained in the database is sparse, however I wanted to use this experience to learn how to design, align and manipulate a relational database. This was a project that spanned a full process from the creation of entity relationships, proper key constraints, a plethora of different techniques in queries, to a final visual representation of data and KPI's essential to the hypothetical company. 

A big part of projects that I undertake is that I like to make them so that they can be continuously developed ad added upon. For this database, I'm currently learning how to and working on a Java/Springboot API to interact with the database via web access.
